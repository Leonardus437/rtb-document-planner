# ✅ LOGIN SYSTEM FIXED

## What Was Fixed:

1. **Removed duplicate AUTH_KEY declarations** - Was causing JavaScript errors
2. **Added proper error handling** - try-catch blocks
3. **Added 100ms delay before redirect** - Ensures session saves to localStorage
4. **Used window.location.replace()** - Prevents back button issues
5. **Added console logging** - For debugging

## Test Login Now:

### Admin Login:
**URL:** https://schemesession.netlify.app/direct-login.html
- Phone: `+250789751597`
- Password: `admin123`
- Redirects to: admin.html

### Teacher Login:
**URL:** https://schemesession.netlify.app/login.html
- Register first at: https://schemesession.netlify.app/register.html
- Then login with same credentials
- Redirects to: index.html

### Test Page (for debugging):
**URL:** https://schemesession.netlify.app/login-test.html
- Direct test of login functions
- Shows detailed results

## Console Should Show:

```
✅ config.js loaded successfully
