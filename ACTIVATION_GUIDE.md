2. **Keep records**: Note down who paid what and when
3. **Transaction IDs**: Always verify transaction ID before activating
4. **Unlimited package**: Lasts 30 days from activation

1. Verify they previously paid (check your records)
2. Use admin panel or console to reactivate
3. Consider keeping a spreadsheet of:
   - User phone number
   - Package purchased
   - Transaction ID
   - Activation date
