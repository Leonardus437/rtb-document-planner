## Technical Implementation

### Backend API Endpoints

#### Create Notification
```http
POST /notifications/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_id": 1,
  "title": "Notification Title",
  "message": "Notification message",
  "type": "info"
}
```

#### Bulk Notification
```http
POST /notifications/bulk
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Announcement Title",
  "message": "Message for all users",
  "type": "success",
  "user_ids": [1, 2, 3] // Optional: specific users
}
```

#### Get User Notifications
```http
GET /notifications/user/{user_id}
```

#### Mark as Read
```http
PUT /notifications/{notification_id}/read
```

#### Get Unread Count
```http
GET /notifications/unread/{user_id}
```

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'info',
    is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Frontend Integration

#### JavaScript Functions
```javascript
// Get notifications for current user
await getNotifications()

// Mark notification as read
await markNotificationAsRead(notificationId)

// Get unread count
await getUnreadCount()

// Display notification bell
await addNotificationBell()

// Show notification panel
await showNotificationPanel()
```

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Use templates** for consistent messaging
2. **Test notifications** before sending to all users
3. **Keep messages clear** and actionable
4. **Use appropriate notification types** (success, info, warning, error)
5. **Don't spam users** - send meaningful notifications only

### For Developers
1. **Always handle errors** when sending notifications
2. **Use async functions** for notification operations
3. **Refresh notification bell** after operations
4. **Test with different user roles**
5. **Handle network failures gracefully**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Notifications Not Appearing
1. Check if backend is running on port 8000
2. Verify user is logged in correctly
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Ensure notification bell is initialized

#### Admin Can't Send Notifications
1. Verify admin login credentials
2. Check if users exist in database
3. Test API endpoints directly
4. Check network connectivity

#### Database Errors
1. Run database initialization: `python backend/init_db.py`
2. Check if Notification table exists
3. Verify user relationships are correct

### Debug Commands

#### Check API Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

#### List All Users
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/users/
```

#### Get User Notifications
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/notifications/user/1
```
