URGENT: UPDATE PYTHONANYWHERE BACKEND WITH COMPLETE CODE
========================================================

The frontend is now fixed to use production API only, but the PythonAnywhere backend 
needs to be updated with the complete code that includes session plans and schemes endpoints.

STEPS TO UPDATE PYTHONANYWHERE:
1. Go to https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/leonardus437/
2. Click "Files" tab
3. Navigate to your main.py file
4. Replace ALL content with the code from FINAL_COMPLETE_BACKEND.py
5. Click "Save"
6. Go to "Web" tab
7. Click "Reload leonardus437.pythonanywhere.com"

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- ✅ Admin dashboard will show real data (2 users, 1 premium, etc.)
- ✅ Session plan generation will work
- ✅ Scheme of work generation will work
- ✅ No more "Failed to fetch" errors
- ✅ No more "localhost:8000" references

FRONTEND CHANGES DEPLOYED:
- ✅ config.js now uses production API only
- ✅ admin.html redirects to working version
- ✅ All pages use https://leonardus437.pythonanywhere.com

AFTER UPDATE, TEST:
1. Visit: https://schemesession.netlify.app/system-status.html
2. Should show all green checkmarks
3. Admin dashboard should show real data
4. Session plans and schemes should generate successfully

The backend code in FINAL_COMPLETE_BACKEND.py includes:
- All user management endpoints
- Session plans endpoints (/session-plans)
- Schemes of work endpoints (/schemes-of-work)
- Statistics endpoint (/stats)
- Proper CORS configuration
- Admin account pre-loaded
