## User Identification System

### How It Works:
1. **First Visit**: User must register (name, phone, institution)
2. **Unique ID**: System generates unique User ID (e.g., `USER_1738123456789_abc123def`)
3. **localStorage**: Profile saved in browser
4. **Admin Access**: All users visible in admin dashboard
5. **Phone Number**: Primary identifier for admin

### User Profile Structure:
```javascript
{
  userId: "USER_1738123456789_abc123def",
  name: "Test Teacher",
  phone: "+250788123456",
  email: "test@iprc.rw",
  institution: "IPRC Kigali",
  registeredAt: "2025-01-29T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
